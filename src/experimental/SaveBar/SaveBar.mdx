# SaveBar

This is a composed component that renders children in a simplified, organized and consistent manner.

The default children are controlled by three prop objects, **saveButtonProps**, **cancelButtonProps**, and **refreshButtonProps**. The SaveButton and the CancelButton will render by default. The RefreshButton will only render if **refreshButtonProps** are supplied.

The **isJustifiedRight** prop will reverse the order of the children, and justify them to the right.

Supplying the SaveBar with children using default React syntax will override the default render and render the custom children.

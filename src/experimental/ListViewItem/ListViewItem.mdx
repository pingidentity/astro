# ListViewItem

The ListViewItem allows easy creation of list items. Styles have been included to match Ping specs. Use the data prop to pass in text, subtext and an image, mdi or svg icon.

### Recommended Use
This component is intended to be used inside a ListView component. See the [ListAndPanel](./?path=/story/experimental-recipes-listandpanel--list-and-panel) and [ScrollableListView](./?path=/story/experimental-recipes-scrollablelistview--scrollable-list-view)
recipes for a more detailed examples.

#### Icons and Images
Add an icon by passing an mdi or svg icon to the `data.icon` prop. Default size is 25px.

Add an image by passing an object with a `src` key to the `data.image` prop. `alt` and `aria-label` keys are supported but not required. Default size is 35px.

If both an icon and an image are provided the icon will be rendered.

For other Icon or Image sizes use slots with `rightOfData`.

#### Slots
The slots prop has been provided for added flexibility. Use the `rightOfData` slot to add icons, badges or other elements to the right of the data
section. Use the `leftOfData` slot to add elements to the left of the data element. Note that when the
leftOfData slot is used, it will prevent an icon in the `data.icon` prop from rendering and remove all margins/padding on the left of the data.

#### Children
To add action controls, pass control elements as `{children}`. All elements passed in this way will be right justified and center aligned. Use one of the following
styled control components to easily match Ping specs.
- [ListViewItemEditButton](./?path=/story/experimental-styledlistitem-controls-listitemeditbutton--default)
- [ListViewItemMenu](./?path=/story/experimental-styledlistitem-controls-listitemmenu--default)
- [ListViewItemSwitchField](./?path=/story/experimental-styledlistitem-controls-listitemswitchfield--default)

### Note:
The nature of components that have been styled to match design specs is that as design specs are updated, so will the matching component. Be aware that styles 
inside this component may be adjusted in small ways over time.

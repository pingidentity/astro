#  The Experimental Folder

The Experimental section is a pre-release staging area, meant to showcase works in progress. As such, anything contained in this part of the docs is considered to be under development and subject to change while the UX Development team works to gather feedback and make things production ready. We encourage Astro consumers to provide feedback at any point, either through our Ping Identity Slack channels, GitHub issues, or email.

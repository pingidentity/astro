# TimeField

The TimeField component allows users to enter and edit time values using a keyboard. Each part of the time is displayed in individual editable segments.

When using strings as props for different TimeValues, ensure that they adhere to the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

This component is built on [useTimeField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTimeField.html) from React Aria
and [useTimeFieldState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useTimeFieldState.html) from React Stately.

### Required components 

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

| Keys | Functions |

| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Up and down Arrow keys | When segments are focused, it increments and decrements time values |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:

- The **`aria-label`** attribute is used to provide an accessible name.
- The hidden input, TimeField, and all spin buttons have an **`aria-labelledby`** attribute pointing to the label ID, along with the **`aria-label`** attribute for an accessible name.
- Each spin button has an **`aria-valuenow`**, **`aria-valuemin`**, and **`aria-valuemax`** to represent the current value, minimum allowed value, and maximum allowed value.

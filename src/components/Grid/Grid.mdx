A responsive layout utility component which utilizes [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) to position child elements in a variety of ways. Great for providing mobile-first UI layouts.

Uses the [responsive values](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop#responsive-values) array syntax and the [Grid from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/grid/).

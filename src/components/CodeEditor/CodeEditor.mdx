# CodeEditor

The Code Editor component is a tool for editing and displaying code snippets in an application. 
It provides syntax highlighting, shows line numbers, and validates errors in the code.
In addition, it supports standard IDE keyboard interactions like tab-to-indent.

The CodeEditor component should be used for complex use cases that require an interactive environment, support for various programming languages, functionalities like linting, keyboard interactions, and real-time updates. 
When code snippets need to be presented in a read-only format, use [CodeView](./?path=/docs/components-codeview--docs).

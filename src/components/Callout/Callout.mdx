# Callout

Callouts are persistent box-like components that display brief status reports regarding continuing and developing conditions. 
Callouts should contain only 1 or 2 pieces of information and display at the top of the panels or above the related content without blocking important information on the screen, and should not be stacked on top of each other.

### Required components

This component requires the [Text](./?path=/docs/components-text--default) component. 

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

The callout itself is not focusable but the components within it are. 
These keys provide additional functionality to the component.

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Space or Enter | Selects the component within. |
| Tab | Focuses the component within and follows the page tab sequence. |

#### Screen readers

This component uses the **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name.

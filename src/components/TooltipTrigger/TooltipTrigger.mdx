# TooltipTrigger

The TooltipTrigger is a composed component that displays additional information on hover, click or focus. 
This component is typically used as a design fallback for contextual information that may be hard to convey otherwise. It can also be disabled without disabling button-press events.

This component should provide useful, supplementary information or clarification regarding the element it points to. 
It shouldn’t contain essential content, error or feedback messages, or action items.

Tooltips cannot contain interactive content (links, buttons) according to the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/).

### Required Components

This component requires the [Button](./?path=/docs/components-button--default) and Tooltip components.

### Accessibility

#### Screen Readers

The trigger button uses the **`aria-describedby`** attribute with the tooltip container ID to announce the screen reader content when it becomes visible.

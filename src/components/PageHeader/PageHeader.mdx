# PageHeader

The PageHeader component allows for easy creation of page header content. It comes with pre-defined styles that match Ping specs.

### Recommended Use
The PageHeader is intended to be used at the top of a page.

Pass `buttonProps` to add actions and customizations to the '+' button. Omit `buttonProps` if the '+' button is not needed. 

### Children
Text and Links passed as children will be styled to match Ping specs.

### Note:
Components styled to match design specs may be updated over time as design specs change. Be aware that styles within this component may undergo minor adjustments over time to stay in sync with the latest design specifications.

# RequirementsList

The RequirementsList component is used to display password requirements and includes indicators showing the requirement status.

This list should:
- Be sorted in a logical way that makes content easy to scan.
- Have each item associated with an action.

The list shouldn’t use punctuation at the end of each line.

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

# Text

The Text component is used to display text and supports [Typography Props from Styled System](https://styled-system.com/table/#typography) from Styled System.

Text should be adjusted in terms of font weight, size and formatting to emphasize hierarchy, and shouldn’t: rely only on color to convey importance.

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

# IconBadge

IconBadge is a pair of overlapping icons. It should be paired with text or a [tooltip](./?path=/story/components-tooltiptrigger--icon-with-tooltip) when its meaning is unclear.
It should only have Icon as a child component.

The component follows the same pattern as icons. Check [Icon](./?path=/docs/components-icon--default) component for best practices.

### Required Components

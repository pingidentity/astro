# AccordionGroup

Accordions are for grouping big chunks of content into easier-to-scan headers, which the user can expand when they want to read what is associated with that header.

Accordions should be used:
- To organize related information.
- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when itâ€™s not crucial that users review the content.
- When white space is at a minimum and content cannot be displayed all at once. 
- With Slots props to insert extra UI elements next to headings.

Accordions should not have focusable items as children.

AccordianItem labels should not include interactive elements.

It is built on React Aria [useAccordion](https://reactspectrum.blob.core.windows.net/reactspectrum/d77b35e970e5549f66b47a83f07423f5c93b7297/docs/react-aria/useAccordion.html).

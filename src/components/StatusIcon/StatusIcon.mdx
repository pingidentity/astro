# StatusIcon

StatusIcon are small images that represent status of an item, often providing visual feedback to users.

Import icons from the [Material UI Icon Library](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

It is built on top of the [Box from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/box/) and uses the available [props from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop).

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

#### Screen Readers

If the icon has a title associated with it, the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute is used to provide the label ID.

# Separator

The Separator component is a basic separator that accepts most of the styling props from [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/table).

This component should be used to divide or group content within a page. However, it shouldn't be placed between the last component and the footer or between buttons.

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components. 

### Accessibility

#### Screen Readers

The **`aria-orientation`** attribute indicates whether the  orientation is horizontal, vertical, unknown, or ambiguous

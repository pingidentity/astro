# HelpHint

HelpHints display information intended to help users enter, select or provide the appropriate information in a field. This component can be customized, and consists of the [TooltipTrigger](./?path=/docs/components-tooltiptrigger--default) and [IconButton](./?path=/docs/components-iconbutton--default).

When implementing this component, use short, clear language and a text size relative to the trigger button. They should not block important information when the popover displays, nor should it be used to communicate important information.

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

### Accessibility

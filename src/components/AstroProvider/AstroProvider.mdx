# AstroProvider

The AstroProvider component provides a standard background, global styles, and the Astro theme, by default. This component should be used:
- Sparingly and cautiously when altering the default theme.
- With the **`themeOverrides`** prop to change some base theme properties.
- When targeting multiple components on a global scale.

It should not be used for minor CSS alterations. Use sx objects instead.

### Required components 

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

# Modal

Modals (also known as modal windows, overlays, and dialogs) are large UI elements that sit on top of an application's main window.
To return to the application's main interface, users must interact with the modal.

This component must be wrapped in an OverlayProvider and the first child component should be a trigger, such as a button.

If the modal is used to display an error message, it displays after users perform an action and require a response. 
These messages should be short, meaningful, free of technical jargon, and follow status color guidelines. 
They can also be used to educate users, but don’t try to explain complicated troubleshooting processes in error messages.

Error messages should clearly explain: 
- What happened
- Why it happened, if that’s relevant
- The steps users should take to resolve the issue

See our [Error message writing guidelines](https://pingidentity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCC/pages/21137273/Error+messages) for additional information. 

Modals should:
- Be used for important warnings and information requests as a way to prevent or correct critical errors.
- Be used to break down complex workflow to not overwhelm the user.
- Have all the critical information inside it to help users make decisions.

Modals should not:
- Be nested inside or replaced by another modal.
- Be overused as it disrupts the user’s workflow and requires a response.
- Have content that requires scrolling. If the content length is exceedingly large or requires complex forms, use the [OverlayPanel](./?path=/docs/components-overlaypanel--default) component.
- Be used for brief warnings and alerts, use the [Messages](./?path=/docs/components-messages--default) component instead.

### Required Components

This component requires the OverlayProvider and [Button](./?path=/docs/components-button--default) components. 

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Modal](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/dialog/) accessibility guidelines.

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Key | Functions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Tab | The trigger component and the content in the modal are focusable using the Tab key.   |
|  | When a modal opens, focus moves to an element contained in the modal, which is usually the first focusable element. If the first focusable element does not make sense, tabindex=”-1” should be added to a static element at the top of the modal, which could be the panel title. |
| Space or Enter | Opens the modal when the trigger is focused. Once opened, the focus is locked inside the modal. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Esc | Pressing the escape key closes the modal and adds focus to the previously focused component. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The button uses the **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name.
- The **`aria-labelledby`** attribute is supplied with label ID.
- The **`aria-modal`** attribute allows the assistive technologies to inform users that the ability to interact with or access other content on the page requires the modal dialog to be closed.

## Install

To get rolling with PingUX, first clone down the repository, make sure Lerna is installed, and run `lerna bootstrap` in the root directory. The monorepo works well with `node@10`.

## Developing

Each package's respective npm/yarn commands can be run out of their folder under `packages/`. Just navigate into the package you want to work with and run the yarn commands like normal.

## Testing

Commands can be run from each respective package's directory _or_ the top level if prefixed with `lerna` instead of `yarn`.

Testing: `yarn run test`

Coverage: `yarn run coverage`

Linting: `yarn run lint`

## Deployment

We use a single Jenkins pipeline for deployments of all of the packages in the monorepo. You can see it [here](https://jenkins-icecream.pingdev.tools/job/devtools-controlled-pipelines/job/PingOne/job/UI-Library/job/generic-release/).

This project provides static HTML and CSS to build end-user pages.

#### Install

You can install the module from Ping's Artifactory.

```
yarn add @pingux/end-user
```

The module consists of a `package.json` file and `end-user.css` + assets at the root. The source `css` folder is also included.

#### Demo Site

You can see the styles in action with code examples at http://uilibrary.ping-eng.com/end-user/

#### Scripts

You can also pull down the repo and view the catalog of components locally by running the server.

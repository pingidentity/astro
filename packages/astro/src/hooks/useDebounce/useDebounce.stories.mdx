# useDebounce

A hook that provides a simple way to debounce updates to a variable.

## Overview

This hook can be used to debounce a value so it is only updated after a certain amount of time has passed. 
This can be particularly useful for any action involving a network request after a user types, such as searching.

## Usage

To use this hook, import it from `@pingux/astro/lib/hooks`.

`import { useDebounce } from "@pingux/astro/lib/hooks";`

## API

<br />

### useDebounce([props]) => result

<br />

#### props

Type: `Object` Default: `{}`

* **value**

  Type: `unknown`

  The value to be updated after a period of time has passed.

* **delay**

  Type: `number`

  The amount of time (in milliseconds) to debounce.

#### result

Type: `any`

The updated value after `delay` milliseconds have passed with no additional updates.


## Example

const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(null);
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce({ searchTerm, value: 500 });

`debouncedSearchTerm` will only be updated after 500 milliseconds have passed since `searchTerm` was updated without
an additional update.

## Creating Theme Overrides

The Astro component library ships with [a default theme](/story/astro-theme--page) based on Ping's 
Astro design system. To extend, modify, or replace the theme to change the visual look 
of components then there are two options:

1. `themeOverrides` - this prop on the `AstroWrapper` component facilitates extending and modifying the base theme. 
See AstroWrapper custom theme story for more information.
The `themeOverrides` prop uses [the merge function from ThemeUI](https://theme-ui.com/guides/merging-themes/).
With this approach, only variants that you specifically target within your new theme will be changed, 
but those not targeted will still inherit styles from the default theme. If you are attempting to keep the majority of styling from the 
Astro Design System (and therefore base astroTheme), but wish to override a few global styles, this is the favored approach. 

2. `defaultTheme` - this is another prop on the `AstroWrapper` component, 
but this _replaces_ the base theme with the object passed in. We discourage using this in most situations.


To assist in customizing the theme, Astro includes the following objects:
- astroTheme - The base Astro theme, includes all styles from the Astro design system: `@pingux/astro/lib/styles/theme`
- endUserTheme - An alternative theme which matches Ping's End User library styling: `@pingux/astro/lib/styles/themes/end-user`
- overrideUILib - An override object to address conflicting styles between Astro and Ping's UI Library CSS: `@pingux/astro/lib/styles/themeOverrides/uiLibraryOverride`




## How to Customize Astro Styles

Components typically use a custom variant to apply styles. See the [Astro Theme](/story/astro-theme--page) documentation for more information on this. To override these styles, 
the variant included within the component will need to be targeted. For example, to override the border color on all primary buttons, 
search within the /theme file for the button structure. Within this file, `buttons` is not nested within another object so,
the theme structure is straight forward and would look like:

```
const myThemeOverride = {
    buttons: {
        primary: {
            borderColor: 'red',
        }
    }
}
```

Some components and their variants are nested, for example components within /Forms. To change the hovered border color on a TextArea component, the following would be added to myThemeOverride.


```
const myThemeOverride = {
    forms: {
        textarea: {
            '&:hover': {
                borderColor: 'red',
            }
        }
    },
    buttons: {
        primary: {
            borderColor: 'red',
        }
    }
}
```

These overrides can then be passed to the `themeOverrides` prop on the `AstroWrapper` as mentioned above.

# Theme Overview
Astro utilizes [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) to apply styles consistently using their
[theme specification](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec). This allows us to specify reusable colors,
font sizes, component variants, and so much more. This document will focus on how we structure
our theme object to align with the Theme UI paradigm and is meant to serve as a reference for any
developers wishing to add or edit the theme.

# Theme Values

This is the raw theme object that is passed in the Astro wrapper. Its values can be referenced in `styled-system` properties. See [https://styled-system.com/table](https://styled-system.com/table) for details.

For example, to set a background color on a `Box` component, you can reference one of the keys under the `colors` section. Like: `bg="black"`, `bg="accent.20"`, `bg="decorative.4"`, or `bg="critical.bright"`.

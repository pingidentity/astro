# OverlayPanel

OverlayPanel is a generic container component that can overlay other components on a page. 
In Astro, this component is used to display detailed information and present modal interactions.

**Note**: The way the OverlayPanel displays in Firefox browser differs from other browsers. This is a Storybook-only issue and will not affect the way it works in your application, but test your application in Chrome or Safari.

This component should:
- Be used to show content that is too long to put in a popover or modal.
- Show content related to the state of the main view.

This component should not:
- Be overused, as it disrupts the userâ€™s workflow.
- Cover content that is contextually relevant to the overlay being displayed.

### Required Components

This component requires the OverlayProvider component.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Key | Functions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Tab | The trigger is focusable using the Tab key and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Space or Enter | Opens or closes the panel when the trigger is focused. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Esc | Pressing the escape key closes the overlay and focuses on the previous focusable component. |

#### Screen Readers

The trigger button uses the **`aria-expanded`** attribute to indicate the expansion and collapse of content.

# SelectField

The component allows items to be selected from a drop-down list and displayed in the field.
It is a variation of the [LinkSelectField](./?path=/docs/form-linkselectfield--default) component that uses [useSelect](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSelect.html) from React Aria and [useSelectState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useSelectState.html) from React Stately and does not rely on native browsers or mobile implementations.

The SelectField component should be used to present choices between mutually exclusive options.

It shouldn’t be used:
- When there are fewer than three options. Use the [RadioGroupField](./?path=/docs/form-radiogroupfield--default) component instead. 
- If the user input can't be predicted using the preset values and the exact input value is important to specify, use the [TextField](./?path=/docs/form-textfield--default) component instead.
- For large complex lists. The user should be able to easily scan and navigate the list. 
If the list is large, use the [ComboBoxField](./?path=/docs/form-comboboxfield--default) component instead.

### Required components

This component requires the OverlayProvider and Item originating from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).

These keys provide additional functionality to the component.

#### Screen readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The trigger button uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute to reference the label ID, the **`aria-expanded`** attribute to indicate the expansion or collapse of the popover, 
- The **`aria-haspopup`** attribute indicates the type of popup content as a listbox. Once expanded, the **`aria-controls`** attribute is added to the button pointing to the popover. 
- The component uses the **`aria-invalid`** attribute to detect incorrect values or status errors, and is set to “False” by default.
- The listbox uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute pointing to the label ID.
- Each option in the list uses the **`aria-selected`** attribute to indicate the selection state, **`aria-posinset`** to give the option’s position in the current set of list items, and **`aria-setsize`** to define the current set of options. The default **`aria-disabled`** value is false for each option.

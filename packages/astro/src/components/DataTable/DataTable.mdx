# DataTable

DataTables are containers that display data in rows, columns, and cells, which allows users to quickly scan, sort, and compare information. This component was inspired by [TableView](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/TableView.html)
from React Spectrum and build using [useTableState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useTableState.html)
from React Stately.

Columns are defined within the DataTableHeader component with the DataTableColumn component, and rows are defined within the DataTableBody component with the DataTableRow component. 
Rows contain DataTableCell components that correspond to each column.

DataTables should:
- Contain vertically aligned content.
- Use multiple heading rows for higher-level column groupings.
- Use column dividers sparingly.

They should not use different indicators to represent empty fields.

### Required Components

This component requires these additional React Spectrum components:
- [TableHeader](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html#:~:text=defined%20using%20the-,TableHeader,-%2C%20Column%2C) aliased DataTableHeader
- [Column](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html#:~:text=the%20TableHeader%2C-,Column,-%2C%20TableBody%2C) aliased DataTableColumn
- [Cell](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html#:~:text=Row%2C%20and-,Cell,-components%2C%20which%20support) aliased DataTableCell
- [Row](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html#:~:text=%2C%20TableBody%2C-,Row,-%2C%20and%20Cell%20components) aliased DataTableRow
- [TableBody](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTable.html#:~:text=%2C%20Column%2C-,TableBody,-%2C%20Row%2C%20and) aliased DataTableBody

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Tab | Moves focus to the next focusable component. All focusable components in the table are included in the page tab sequence. | 
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Space or Enter  | Focuses the component and triggers an action if one is associated with it. |
| Arrow keys | Can be used to navigate between the components in the table. |
| Focus on a row and scroll down | Shifts the focus to the entire table, not the previously focused row. |
| Home or page up | Shifts the focus to the first row. |
| End or page down | Shifts the focus to the last visible row. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The **`aria-label`** attribute is used to provide an accessible name.
- The **`aria-rowcount`** and **`aria-columncount`** attributes are used to indicate the total number of rows and columns in the grid structure. 
- The DataTableHeader uses the **`aria-rowindex`** attribute and DataTableColumn uses the **`aria-colindex`** attribute to enumerate the header row and columns. 
- In the body component, the DataTableRow uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute and the grid ID to identify the component and the **`aria-rowindex`** attribute is passed to each row.
- Each DataTableCell uses the **`aria-colindex`** attribute to enumerate the columns within each row.

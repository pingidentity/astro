# Stepper

The Stepper component acts as a wrapper for individual step components. 
It is used to display progress through a sequence of logical and numbered steps, usually within a configuration wizard.

This component should be used:
- To reveal or hide sections of content.
- For progressive disclosure.

It shouldnâ€™t have more than 6 steps or be used as a replacement for a static label or text.

### Required Components

This component requires the Item originating from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html) and [Text](./?path=/docs/components-text--default) components.

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Stepper](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Function |
| ---- | ---- |
| Tab | The field is focusable using the Tab key and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Arrow keys | When this field is focused, the arrow keys can be used to navigate through the steps. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component.  |
| Home(Fn + Right Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + Home| Shifts the focus to the first step. |
| End(Fn + Left Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + End | Shifts the focus to the last step. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The **`aria-orientation`**  attribute indicates whether the orientation is horizontal, vertical, unknown, or ambiguous. 
- Each step uses the **`aria-selected`**  attribute to indicate the selection status, and the **`aria-control`**  attribute is supplied with the associated panel ID that displays the content.
- Each step uses the **`aria-labelledby`** with the label ID to reference it.

# Button

Buttons are used to trigger actions or events and can contain an icon or a text label. The style used depends on its type:

-  **Primary buttons**: Indicate the call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal dialog, or side panel).
-  **Secondary buttons**: Secondary buttons, the default, often have text labels and can only be used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back.”
-  **Tertiary buttons**: Indicate that lower-priority tasks can be accomplished, and are often used in sections of the UI that have less space, such as cards, lists, or tables.
-  **Danger buttons**: Use these buttons for:

   - Dangerous actions, such as those that lose or destroy data.
   - Primary danger buttons should only be used when the dangerous action is the most likely action, such as the affirmative Delete action in a deletion confirmation dialog.
   - Secondary and tertiary variants can also be used for actions related to current errors, such as resolving them or viewing their details.

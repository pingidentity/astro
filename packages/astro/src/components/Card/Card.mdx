# Card

Cards are usually placed in groups and used to display content related to a single subject. 
The content can consist of multiple components of varying types and sizes.

Card should:
- Relay clear expectations for user interactions.
- Be self-contained and freely placed based on function.
- Be grouped in a uniform layout when the content length and sizes are similar.

Cards shouldnâ€™t contain too much information. Keep it simple and scannable.

This component is built on [Box from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/box) and accepts most [Styled System props](https://styled-system.com/table/).

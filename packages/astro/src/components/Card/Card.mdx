# Card

Card is a Box component used for content display. See Box for a list of props.

### Required Components

Card component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

### Best Practices

Card should:
- relay clear expectations for any user interactions.
- be self-contained and freely placed based on function.
- be grouped in a uniform layout when the content length and sizes are similar.

Card shouldnâ€™t:
- be overflowing with information. Keep it simple for a quick scan of a topic.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Interactive card and the button component within are focusable using the Tab key and can be selected using the Space or Enter key.

# EnvironmentalBreadcrumb

The Environment Picker with Search and Sections support.

### Required components

- Item: Component is exported within Astro but originates from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).
- Badge
- Text
- Box

### Best practices

EnvironmentalBreadcrumb should:
- show a consistent hierarchical structure.

EnvironmentalBreadcrumb shouldnâ€™t:
- display too many levels of items.
- be used as primary navigation.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Each breadcrumb item is focusable using the Tab key.
- Pressing Space or Enter selects the item.
- Shift + Tab moves focus to the previous focusable component.
- Components within the list are accessible via arrow keys.
- Pressing the Escape Key when the panel is expanded, closes it.

#### Screen readers
Each breadcrumb item has **`aria-label`** to give an accessible name to the component. 
The trigger button utilizes **`aria-expanded`** to indicate the expansion and collapse of content.
When expanded, **`aria-controls`** is added to the button pointing to the popup content. 
The attribute **`aria-haspopup`** describes the type of popup content(listbox).

| Aria Attribute | Role | Component |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `aria-label` | link/button | Button |
| `aria-haspopup` | button | Button |
| `aria-expanded` | button | Button |
| `aria-controls` | button | Button |

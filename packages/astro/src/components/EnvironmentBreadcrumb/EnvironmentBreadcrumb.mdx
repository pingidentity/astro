# EnvironmentBreadcrumb

EnvironmentBreadcrumb shows users where they are within the environment hierarchy. 
They take up little space but still provide context for the userâ€™s place in the hierarchy, but should be treated as secondary navigation and never entirely replace the primary navigation.

- Each breadcrumb item uses an **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name.
- The trigger button uses the **`aria-expanded`** attribute to indicate when the content expands and collapses. 
- When expanded, **`aria-controls`** is added to the button pointing to the pop-up content.
- The **`aria-haspopup`** attribute describes the type of content presented.

# TooltipTrigger

The TooltipTrigger is a composed component that displays additional information on hover, click or focus. 
This component is typically used as a design fallback for contextual information that may be hard to convey otherwise. It can also be disabled without disabling button-press events.

This component should provide useful, supplementary information or clarification regarding the element it points to. 
It shouldnâ€™t contain essential content, error or feedback messages, or action items.

### Required Components

This component requires the [Button](./?path=/docs/components-button--default) and Tooltip components.

### Accessibility

#### Screen Readers

The trigger button uses the **`aria-describedby`** attribute with the tooltip container ID to announce the screen reader content when it becomes visible.

# ColorField

The ColorField component allows users to pick a color from a color swatch and use that color. 
The colors must use the same color naming conventions, such as HEX, RBBA, and HSLA. 
Pick one convention and stick with it.

This component uses [useColorField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useColorField.html) from React Aria, 
[useColorFieldState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useColorFieldState.html) from React Stately 
and [React Color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) as a color picker.

### Required Components

This component is built using [useOverLayTrigger](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlayTrigger.html), and requires the 
react-aria [OverlayProvider](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useOverlayTrigger.html#:~:text=contained%20in%20an-,OverlayProvider,-%2C%20which%20is%20used), which is exported from Astro.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component.

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Tab |Focuses the color swatch and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Space or Enter | Opens the color swatch when it is focused. Once opened, the focus moves to the input field and is locked inside the ColorPicker Overlay. |
| Esc | When the picker is open, pressing the escape key closes the overlay and focuses on the previously focused component. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The trigger button uses the **`aria-expanded`** attribute to indicate the expansion and collapse of Chrome Picker.
- When expanded, **`aria-controls`** is added to the button pointing to the Chrome Picker.
- The visibly hidden input uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute supplied with label ID.

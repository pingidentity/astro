# LinkSelectField

The LinkSelectField component collects information from a dropdown menu of options using [useSelect](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSelect.html) from React Aria and 
[useSelectState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useSelectState.html) from React Stately. 
It does not rely on native browser or mobile implementations.

This component should be used to limit the options available to users. 
It should not be used:
- When there are fewer than 3 options for the user to choose from: 
  - Use the [RadioGroupField](./?path=/docs/form-radiogroupfield--default) if users must choose 1 option. 
  - Use the [CheckBoxField](./?path=/docs/form-checkboxfield--default) if users can choose more than 1 option. 
- If the exact input value is important to specify, use the [TextField](./?path=/docs/form-textfield--default).

### Required components

This component requires the OverlayProvider and Item originating from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html). 

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Tab | Focuses the field and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Space or Enter | When the trigger is focused, the menu opens or closes. When the menu item is focused, it selects the listbox option. |
| Arrow keys | Can be used to move the selection in the listbox. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component.|
| Home(Fn + Right Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + Home | Shifts the focus to the first item in the listbox. |
| End(Fn + Left Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + End | Shifts the focus to the last item in the listbox. |
| Esc | Pressing the escape key closes the popover menu and adds focus to the previously focused component.|

#### Screen readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:

- The trigger button uses the **`aria-expanded`** attribute to indicate the expansion or collapse of the popover menu, the  **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name, and the  **`aria-labelledby`** attribute to reference the label.
- The **`aria-haspopup`** attribute indicates the type of popup content as a listbox.
- A visually hidden DismissButton is added for screen reader users to close the overlay in the absence of a dismiss button.
- The listbox in the popover uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute, which also references the label.
- Each option uses the **`aria-selected`** attribute to indicate the selection state,  **`aria-posinset`** to give the option’s position in the current set of list items, and  **`aria-setsize`** to define the current set of options. 
- The **`aria-disabled`** attribute value is “False” for each option, by default.

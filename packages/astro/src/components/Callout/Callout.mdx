# Callout

A box component to display brief status reports of continuing or developing conditions. It is composed of the Box, Icon, and Text components.
It's a persistent component that should be placed at the top of panels or above related content.
If the Callout status is error or warning, the text should include a direct link to instructions on resolving the issue or error.

### Required components

- Link
- Text

### Best practices

Callout should:

- contain 1-2 pieces of information to avoid overwhelming the user.
- include dismiss button when possible although it is optional.

Callout shouldnâ€™t:

- be stacked on top of each other.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Callout itself is not focusable but the link component inside it is focusable using the Tab key and can be selected using the Space or the Enter key.

#### Screen readers

Callout and Icon utilizes `aria-label` to give an accessible name to the components.

| Aria Attribute | Role   | Component    |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `aria-label`   | note   | Box(Callout) |
| `aria-label`   | button | Icon         |

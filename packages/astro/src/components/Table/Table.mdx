# Table

Data tables display information in a grid-like format of rows and columns. 
They organize information in a way that’s easy to scan so that users can look for patterns and develop insights from data. 

Column header names describe the type of content displayed in each column. 
Each row contains data related to a single entity.

Tables should:
- Have consistently aligned content.
- Use multiple heading rows for higher-level grouping of the columns.
- Use column dividers sparingly.

Tables shouldn’t use different indicators to represent empty fields.

This basic component is rendered as an HTML `<table>`, which accepts the `<TableBody>` component and the `<TableHead>` as children.

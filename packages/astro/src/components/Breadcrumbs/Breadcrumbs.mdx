# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs display a hierarchy of links to the current page or resource in an application. They are effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels. 
They take up little space but still provide context for the user’s place in the navigation hierarchy, but should be treated as secondary navigation and never entirely replace the primary navigation.

There are two different types of breadcrumbs:
- **Location-based**: Illustrate the hierarchy and show users where they are within that hierarchy.
- **Path-based**: Show the steps the user took to get to the current page, rather than reflecting the site’s information architecture.

It is built on React Aria [useBreadcrumbs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useBreadcrumbs.html) from React-Aria.

# Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs component wraps an array of BreadcrumbItem components and icons, rendered between each node, sans last-child. It utilizes
[useBreadcrumbs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useBreadcrumbs.html) from React-Aria.

### Required components

- Item: Component is exported within Astro but originates from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).

### Best practices

Breadcrumbs should:
- show a consistent hierarchical structure.
- follow a single direction of navigation.

Breadcrumbs shouldn’t:
- display too many levels of items.

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Breadcrumbs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/breadcrumb/index.html) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Each BreadcrumbItem is focusable using the Tab key.
- Pressing Space or Enter selects the item and navigates to the associated location.
- Shift + Tab moves focus to the previous focusable item.

#### Screen readers

Only the last BreadcrumbItem has **`aria-current`** indicating that the user is currently viewing that page.

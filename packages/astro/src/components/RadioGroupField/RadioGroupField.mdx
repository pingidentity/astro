# RadioGroupField

The RadioGroupField component allows users to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options. 
This component uses [useRadioGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useRadioGroup.html) from React Aria and [useRadioGroupState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useRadioGroupState.html) from React Stately.

RadioGroupField should:
- Offer at least two choices.
- Have a clear label describing the context.
- Include a None option, when appropriate.

RadioGroupField shouldn’t be used to change state or set off an action. Nor should it be used to display a list of more than 6 options. If that’s the case, use the [SelectField](./?path=/story/form-selectfield--default) instead.

### Required components

This component requires the RadioField component.

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA RadioGroup](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/) accessibility guidelines.

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Tab | The field is focusable using the Tab key and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Arrow Keys | Once focused, the radio button can be selected using any of the arrow keys. |
| Space | If the radio button is focused, pressing space selects or deselects it. |

#### Screen readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:

- The **`aria-labelledby`** attribute is used to reference the label, and the **`aria-orientation`**  attribute is set to “Vertical” by default.
- Each radio input also uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute pointing to its label.

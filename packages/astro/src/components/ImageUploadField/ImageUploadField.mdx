#### Screen readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:

- The input uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute to reference the label.
- The trigger button uses the **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name.
- The **`aria-expanded`** attribute is used to indicate the expansion or collapse of the popover.
- The **`aria-haspopup`** attribute indicates the type of popup content as a menu. Once expanded, **`aria-controls`** is added to the button pointing to the popover. 
- The menu uses vertical **`aria-orientation`** by default, and each menu item has a “False” **`aria-disabled`** value.

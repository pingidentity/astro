# Menu

The Menu component is intended to be used as a wrapper for MenuItems. It is based on the [useMenu](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useMenu.html) 
React Aria component, and is often used in a [PopoverMenu](./?path=/story/components-popovermenu--default).

Menus should:
- Only contain the most relevant categories for a quick scan.
- Be used to view actions and not content.

Menus shouldn’t:
- Display more than 5 items to easily interpret the scope of actions.
- Include ellipses (…) in menu item names. An ellipsis indicates that the user action prompt opens a new window.

### Required Components

This component requires the Item component, which is exported within Astro, but originates from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Menu](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/menus/) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Key | Functions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Space or Enter | Selects the menu item. |
| Tab | Focuses the menu item and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Home(Fn + Right Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + Home| Shifts the focus to the first row. |
| End(Fn + Left Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + End | Shifts the focus to the last visible row. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The **`aria-label`** attribute is used to provide an accessible name.
- Each menu option has the default **`aria-disabled`** value as “False.” 
- The **`aria-orientation`** attribute indicates whether the menu is horizontally or vertically oriented, or undefined.

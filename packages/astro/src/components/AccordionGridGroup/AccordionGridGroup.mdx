# AccordionGridGroup

The AccordionGrid is a variation of the accordion component that allows children to be passed into the header and body of each item. AccordionGridItem is a composite component with two children:
- The header controls the expansion of the body.
- The body renders the content. 

The purpose of this component is to allow keyboard interaction with children passed into the Body and Header.

### Required components

- Item: Component is exported within Astro but originates from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).
- Header
- Body

### Best practices

AccordionGridGroup should:
- be used when passing complex or focusable components into an accordion component.
- have short and concise labels.

AccordionGridGroup shouldnâ€™t:
- be used for simple implementation.

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Accordion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion) accessibility guidelines.

#### Keyboard Navigation

- AccordionGrid is focusable using the Tab key and all focusable components within follow the page Tab sequence.
- Pressing Space or Enter when the header panel is focused toggles the component.
- Shift + Tab moves focus to the previous focusable item.
- Components within are accessible via arrow keys.

#### Screen readers

The accordion grid item header button utilizes **`aria-selected`** to indicate the selection state of the row. The header button utilizes **`aria-expanded`** to indicate the expansion and collapse of the content. The **`aria-multiselectable`** attribute indicates that the user can toggle numerous items from the grid. The grid utilizes **`aria-label`** to give an accessible name to itself.

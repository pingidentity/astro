# TextField

The component combines a text input, label, and helper text to enter, read or edit data.

TextField should be used:
- To enter no more than a single line of text.
- To input unique information known only to the user and is difficult to predict with preset options.
- When the data can be entered easily in a free format rather than using complex controls.
- WithSlots props to insert extra UI elements.

TextField shouldn’t be used to collect text longer than a single line. Use the [TextAreaField](./?path=/docs/form-textareafield--default) component instead.

### Required components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components. 

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Tab | The field is focusable using the Tab key and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |

#### Screen readers

This component uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute pointing to the label, and the **`aria-invalid`** attribute to detect incorrect values or status errors, which is set to “False” by default.

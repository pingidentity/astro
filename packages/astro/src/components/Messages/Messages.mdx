# Messages

Use this component to display warning or alert messages, which often highlight an imminent problem or confirm a risky action. 

These messages should:
- Capture the user’s attention at the right time.
- Clearly explain the reason for the warning or alert and the actions the user needs to take.
- Explain what will happen if they don’t act, using the appropriate sense of urgency.
- Be short. Limit the number of alerts to one per component.

See our [Warning and alert messages writing guidelines](https://pingidentity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCC/pages/21137295/Warning+and+alert+messages) for additional information.

# SwitchField

The SwitchField component combines a switch, label, and helper text for a complete solution. 

This component should be used for:
- Communicating activations and deactivations.
- Describing changes with immediate response (setting applied, hidden functionality) without user confirmation. 

It shouldnâ€™t change labels while toggling between states, or have indeterminate partial states. It can only be on or off.

### Required components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components. 

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Switch](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Keys | Functions |
| ---- | --------- |
| Tab | The field is focusable using the Tab key and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component.|
| Space | When focused, Space toggles the switched field. |

#### Screen readers

The hidden input uses the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute to associate the label, the **`aria-label`** attribute to provide an accessible name, 
and the **`aria-checked`** attribute for the switched state.

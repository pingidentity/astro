# Loader

The Loader component provides users information about the loading or computing processes that are occurring. 

This component should be:
- Used to show an indeterminate state.
- Restricted to a single use per view to avoid unnecessary disruption.

It should not be used: 
- When the wait time for a process is known.
- When trying to communicate progression in steps.

The Loader component is based on the [useProgressBar](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useProgressBar.html) React Aria component.

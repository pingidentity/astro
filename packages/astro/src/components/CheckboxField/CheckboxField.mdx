# CheckboxField

This component combines Checkbox, Label, and HelperText for a complete, form-ready solution. 
CheckboxFields are shown as square boxes that users can select or deselect to indicate true or false and should:
- Have short, concise, clear labels.
- Be used in multi-selection lists.
- Be used for options that can be toggled on or off.

These fields should not be used to select from mutually exclusive options. 
Use the [RadioGroupField](./?path=/story/form-radiogroupfield--default) instead.

The CheckboxField component uses [useCheckbox](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useCheckbox.html) from React Aria and
[useToggleState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useToggleState.html) from React Stately.

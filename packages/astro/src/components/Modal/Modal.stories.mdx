# Modal

An overlay dialog for presenting important content that eclipses the rest of the application on screen.

## Overview

Astro-UI's `Modal` component is built with several hooks from React Aria. See the [useDialog](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDialog.html) documentation for more info.

## Usage

The `useModalState` hook from this library is a helper utility to enable easy state management that
the `Modal` component requires. We encourage developers to use these in tandem for supportability
reasons.

## Examples

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.DarkVariant} />
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Modal} />

## Notes

* Even if the `isDismissable` prop is set to `false` or not provided, the `Modal` component can still be close by pressing the `Escape` key.

# PopoverMenu

The PopoverMenu component serves as a wrapper for the Menu component and the associated trigger.
It links the Menu's open state to the trigger's press state to provide the necessary overlay context. 
It primarily uses the [useMenuTrigger](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useMenuTrigger.html) from React Aria 
and [useMenuTriggerState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useMenuTriggerState.html) from React Stately.

The PopoverMenu should:
- Be triggered by a [Button](./?path=/docs/components-button--default) or [IconButton](./?path=/docs/components-iconbutton--default).
- Include actionable labels, such as view, edit, and delete.

The PopoverMenu shouldn’t have more than five options.

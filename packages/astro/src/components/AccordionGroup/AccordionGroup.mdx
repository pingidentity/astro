# AccordionGroup

The Accordion is a vertically stacked list of headers that can be clicked to reveal or hide content associated with them. 
It is built on top of React Aria [useAccordion](https://reactspectrum.blob.core.windows.net/reactspectrum/d77b35e970e5549f66b47a83f07423f5c93b7297/docs/react-aria/useAccordion.html).

### Required components

- Item: Component is exported within Astro but originates from [react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html).

### Best practices

AccordionGroup should:
- be used to hide/reveal a few key pieces of information.
- have short and concise labels.

AccordionGroup shouldnâ€™t:
- have focusable items as children.

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA Accordion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Accordion is focusable using the Tab key and all focusable components within follow the page Tab sequence.
- Pressing Space or Enter when the header panel is focused toggles the component.
- Shift + Tab moves focus to the previous focusable item.

#### Screen readers

The accordion header button utilizes **`aria-expanded`** to indicate the expansion and collapse of the content. 
When expanded **`aria-controls`** is added to the button pointing to the content. 
The button utilizes **`aria-label`** to give an accessible name to itself. The content has **`aria-labelledby`** supplied with button ID.

| Aria Attribute | Role | Component |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `aria-expanded` | button | Button |
| `aria-controls` | button | Button |
| `aria-label` | button | Button |
| `aria-labelledby` | region | AccordionItem |

# AccordionGroup

Accordions are for grouping big chunks of content into easier-to-scan headers, which the user can expand when they want to read what is associated with that header.

Accordions should be used:
- To organize related information.
- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when itâ€™s not crucial that users review the content.
- When white space is at a minimum and content cannot be displayed all at once. 

Accordions should not have focusable items as children.

It is built on React Aria [useAccordion](https://reactspectrum.blob.core.windows.net/reactspectrum/d77b35e970e5549f66b47a83f07423f5c93b7297/docs/react-aria/useAccordion.html).

- When expanded, the **`aria-controls`** attribute is added to the button pointing to the content. The button uses **`aria-label`** to provide an accessible name. 
- The **`aria-labelledby`** attribute is added to the entire accordion component, which is supplied with the button ID.

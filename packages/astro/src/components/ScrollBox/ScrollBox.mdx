# ScrollBox

The ScrollBox component is a container that allows users to scroll through content.

This component should:
- Be used for large amounts of text, such as disclaimers and terms of service.
- Always have a visible scroll bar or default operating scroll bar.

It shouldnâ€™t rely on the user to scroll down to the end. Include important information in the visible area.

### Required Components

This component requires the [Box](./?path=/story/components-box--default) component.

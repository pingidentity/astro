HelpHint is a composed component using the Tooltip trigger and IconButton.
For customization of the trigger icon, please see the [TooltipTrigger](./?path=/docs/components-tooltiptrigger--default) docs.

### Required Components

### Best Practices

HelpHint should:
- use short and clear sentences.
- have text size relative to the trigger button.

HelpHint shouldnâ€™t:
- be blocking important information when the Tooltip is open.
- be used for pertinent information. Try HelperText instead.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

- HelpHint is focusable using the Tab key and can be selected using the Space or Enter key.
- Pressing the Escape Key when the button is focused, closes the Tooltip.

#### Screen Readers

The trigger button has the attribute **`aria-describedby`** with the tooltip ID to announce the Tooltip text upon visibility. 
The **`aria-live`** announces dynamic changes in the content of a live region.

# AstroWrapper

The main wrapper for the Astro application. The AstroWrapper provides a standard background, some global styles, and the Astro theme by default.

### Required components 

- AstroWrapper can be used independently and does not require additional components. 

### Best practices

AstroWrapper should:
- be used sparingly and cautiously when altering the default theme.
- be used with `themeOverrides` prop to extend or change some base theme properties.
- be used when targeting multiple components on a global scale.

AstroWrapper shouldnâ€™t:
- be used for minor CSS alteration. Instead, opt for sx objects.

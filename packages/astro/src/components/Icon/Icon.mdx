# Icon

Icon component fills the default '1em' x '1em' container and maintains the aspect ratio.
It is built on top of the [Box from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/box/) and uses the available [props from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop).
Use SVGR to import SVG files as React components and pass them into this component.
You can also use the theme to color the icon. 
Be sure to pass dimensions: false in web pack config (see [SVGR docs](https://react-svgr.com/docs/options/#dimensions)).
Otherwise, Icon will not be resizable by size prop. 
Icons can also be imported from the [Material UI Icon Library](https://materialdesignicons.com/) or from [@pingux/mdi-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pingux/mdi-react).
When importing an icon, it is recommended to import from @pingux/mdi-react to allow the title prop to be utilized for accessibility.

### Required Components

- Icon component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

### Best Practices

Icon should:
- have sufficient space in between and be centrally aligned when used in a group.
- be paired with a text or tooltip when the icon fails to provide suitable context.
- have a size relative to text when used together.
- have a title associated with it.

Icon shouldnâ€™t:
- use letters as part of the design.
- be randomly scaled to fit the layout. 

### Accessibility

#### Labelling

The Icon component accepts the title prop:
`title={{ id: 'unique id', name: 'short description of the icon'}}`.
The `name` will be passed inside `<title>` element of the SVG.
The `id` is optional. If not specified, it will be generated automatically.
This is needed to make SVG icon accessible.

#### Screen Readers

If the icon has a title associated with it, the SVG has **`aria-labelledby`** with the title ID supplied to it.

| Aria Attribute | Role | Component |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `aria-labelledby` | graphical-document | Icon |

# Icon

Icons are small images that represent concepts or capabilities that often provide information or lead users to other pages within the application. 

Icon should be:
- Centrally aligned when used in a group with an appropriate amount of space between them.
- Paired with text or a tooltip when its intention is not immediately evident. 
- Relatively sized when used with text.

Icon shouldnâ€™t:
- Include letters in the icon design.
- Be randomly scaled to fit the layout.

Regarding sizing, this component uses the **1em x 1em** container by default and maintains the aspect ratios. You can:

- Use SVGR to import SVG files as React components and then pass them into icon components. 
- Use the theme to color the icon.
  
  **Note**: Ensure that the dimensions in Webpack configuration file are set to false, or the icon cannot be resized using the size property. 
  See [SVGR docs](https://react-svgr.com/docs/options/#dimensions) for more information. 
- Import icons from the [Material UI Icon Library](https://materialdesignicons.com/)

It is built on top of the [Box from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/box/) and uses the available [props from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop).

### Required Components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

### Accessibility

#### Labelling

The Icon component accepts the title prop:
`title={{ id: 'unique id', name: 'short description of the icon'}}`.
The `name` will be passed inside `<title>` element of the SVG.
The `id` is optional. If not specified, it will be generated automatically.
This is needed to make SVG icon accessible.

#### Screen Readers

If the icon has a title associated with it, the **`aria-labelledby`** attribute is used to provide the label ID.

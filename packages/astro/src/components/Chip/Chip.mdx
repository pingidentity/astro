# Chip

Chip is a compact Box component used to enter information as options. 
It utilizes the available [props from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop).

### Required Components

Chip component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

### Best Practices

Chip should:
- be clearly & descriptively labeled.
- only display a single label.
- be used as a filtering cue or contextual support.

Chip shouldnâ€™t:
- be used as buttons.
- substitute a label for an icon.

### Accessibility

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Chip itself is not focusable; when components are added inside it, they can be focused using the Tab key and selected using the Space or Enter key.

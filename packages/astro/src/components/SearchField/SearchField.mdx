# SearchField

The SearchField component renders a search field with associated controls, including visual elements and keyboard interaction handlers.
It is built with [useSearchField](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useSearchField.html) from React Aria and [useSearchFieldState](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/useSearchFieldState.html) from React Stately.

This component should be:
- Used for searching and filtering.
- Limited to a single use per page.

It shouldnâ€™t:
- Use important information as placeholders. Once the search term is entered, the placeholder is no longer visible.
- Be used if all the information is easily accessible and within view.

### Required components

This component can be used independently and does not require additional components.

# Link

This basic link component is built on [Link from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/link) and [useLink](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useLink.html) from React Aria.

Links should:
- Have the same font size as surrounding text when used inline.
- Be considerate of the screen reader. Write descriptive link text and alternate text.

Link shouldnâ€™t be used in titles, and preferably used within the body text.

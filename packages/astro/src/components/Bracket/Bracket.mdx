# Bracket

The Bracket component displays information in a hierarchical view of the content structure. 
Items such as headings, directories, and subitems are displayed in a tree structure, which shows how these items are related to each other.

Brackets should avoid cross-referencing. Try separating the content into sections instead. 
Brackets shouldnâ€™t display too many levels of depth to avoid overflow.

### Required components

This component requires the [Badge](./?path=/docs/components-badge--default),[Box](./?path=/story/components-box--default), and [Text](./?path=/docs/components-text--default) components.

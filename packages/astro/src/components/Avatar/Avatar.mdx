# Avatar

Avatars are graphical representations of a user, and are usually photos, illustrations, or the user’s initials. When photos or illustrations aren’t available, the user’s initials are used instead. 
The alternate text used on the image cannot be empty as it describes the function/appearance of the image.

This component is built on [Avatar from Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/components/avatar/).

### Required components

# ListView

ListViews are used to display a list of items. Users can select, view, or edit items in this list.
This virtualized component supports asynchronous data in infinitely scrollable lists. 

This component should:
- Be used to list items that contain a significant amount of information within them.
- Be able to access ListItem information.

It shouldn’t be used to list items that only have a single piece of information.

### Required Components

This component requires [ListItem](./?path=/docs/components-listitem--default).

### Accessibility

This component should adhere to the [WAI-ARIA ListBox](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) accessibility guidelines. 

#### Keyboard Navigation

These keys provide additional functionality to the component. 

| Key | Functions |
| ---- | ---- |
| Space or Enter | Selects the item. |
| Tab | Focuses item and follows the page tab sequence. |
| Shift + Tab | Moves focus to the previous focusable component. |
| Arrow keys | Can be used to move the selection in the menu.  |
| Home(Fn + Right Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + Home | Shifts the focus to the first row. |
| End(Fn + Left Arrow Key) Or Control/Command + End | Shifts the focus to the last visible row. |

#### Screen Readers

This component uses the following attributes to assist screen readers:
- The **`aria-label`** attribute is used to provide an accessible name.
- The **`aria-rowcount`**  and **`aria-columncount`**  attributes are used to indicate the total number of rows and columns in the grid structure. 
- The **`aria-multiselectable`**  attribute is used to indicate that users can toggle between items in the grid. 
- Each ListViewItem uses the **`aria-rowindex`**  attribute, which defines a component's position in the total number of rows. 
- Each item also uses the aria-label, **`aria-colindex`**  attributes to indicate the component’s column position and aria-selected to indicate the currently selected state.

#### NOTES:
- When building a ListView, for styling consistency, its recommended that you use the [StyledListItem](./?path=/story/experimental-styledlistitem--default). See the [ListAndPanel](./?path=/story/experimental-recipes-listandpanel--list-and-panel) and [ScrollableListView](./?path=/story/experimental-recipes-scrollablelistview--scrollable-list-view) recipes for a more detailed examples.
- ListView wraps ListItems with padding and height styles, when using the StyledListItem use the `listViewItem.styledListItem` variant to override this.

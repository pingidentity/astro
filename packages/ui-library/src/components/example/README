This is just an example of a reusable component.

The CSS and the PNG resources are just for demonstration purposes;
if the component needs such resources for core functionality, these
resources can be defined/required in the JSX, in which case the
consumer of the JSX file (ie. the project which uses such components)
much resolve these sort of requires; for webpack, see the file/url
loaders defined in webpack.dev.config.js

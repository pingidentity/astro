We welcome submissions to the UI Library codebase, especially if you’ve found both a bug and a solution to that bug. The project is managed on Gerrit here: https://hg-od01.corp.pingidentity.com/r/#/admin/projects/ui-library

To submit a change:
1. Create a UIP ticket for your issue in Jira.
2. Create a branch on Gerrit named with your ticket number.
3. Commit and push your change to your branch.
    * The commit message should start with the ticket number.
    * The command to push is `git push origin HEAD:refs/for/[branch name]`
4. A change set will be created on Gerrit, and the build process will kick off.
    * If the build succeeds, add the UX-DEV group to the reviewers.
    * If the build fails, reach out for help on [#ui-coalition](https://pingidentity.slack.com/messages/C0P4USREK).
5. Change the status of your ticket to “In Review”.
6. We require two members of the team to approve a change set. Usually, one will +1 the change, and the second will +2 it. Once this is done, you can submit the change to your branch.
7. Finally, if all went well, assign your Jira ticket to a member of the UX Dev team, and they will merge your change into master for the next release.
8. Once your change is merged, the UX Dev team member will close your ticket.

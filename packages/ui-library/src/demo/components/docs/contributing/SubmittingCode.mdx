We welcome submissions to the UI Library codebase, especially if youâ€™ve found both a bug and a solution to that bug. The project is managed on Gitlab here: https://gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com/ux/pingux

To submit a change:
1. Create a UIP ticket for your issue in Jira. Please include the current fix version. 
2. Create a branch using the following naming conventions:
    * Please use a single dash in place of a space
    * Branch name should start with UIP ticket info and contain a short title in lower case
    * Example: UIP-1001-short-title-of-ticket
3. Commit and push your change and add a short commit message.
4. Create a merge request on Gitlab (ensure the target branch is set to master), and the build process will kick off.
    * If the build fails, reach out for help on #ui-coalition.
5. We require two members of the team to approve a change set. Once this is done, you can submit the change to your branch.
6. Finally, if all went well, assign your Jira ticket to a member of the UX Dev team, and they will merge your change into master for the next release.
7. Once your change is merged, the UX Dev team member will close your ticket.

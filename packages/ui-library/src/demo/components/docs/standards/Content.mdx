This page is an attempt to track correct content usage in our products. Post questions, suggestions, and additions to [#ux-questions](https://pingidentity.slack.com/archives/CRL34MKUM).

You can also view and make comments on the working document here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZVti3Ok-teI40A_pHKRpvkb5iBy1GV7Ub8MM9HCN2Yc/edit?usp=sharing

## Capitalization
* Buttons are title case, like "Delete Application"
* Links can be either sentence case or title case, depending on context
* If a link is being used to perform an action, it should be title case, like "+ Add Row"
* Links should be sentence case when they appear within other content
* If a standalone link is not an action and is a complete sentence, it should be sentence case like "Read more about this on our documentation site"

## Formats
Our standard datetime format is 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:MM:SSa'.

* Dates should look like "2018-09-05"
* Times should look like "03:12:00pm"
* Datetimes should look like "2018-09-05 03:12:00pm"

## Language
* Buttons and link button labels should be phrased as verbs with objects when appropriate, like "+ Add Certificate" or "Change Token Provider"
* The titles of popups and popovers should match the labels of the buttons that triggered them
* Buttons for completing or confirming an action can be more terse, like "Save" or "Done" or "Delete"
* "Save" should refer to a singular change. "Done" is used when completing a multi-step process (like a wizard)

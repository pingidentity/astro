We provide several templates for two main reasons:
* To demonstrate how to create standard layouts using library components.
* To provide standard cases for integration testing and cross-browser testing.

## Finding Templates
If you are building a new page, start by going to the Templates section of this demo site. Hopefully, you will be able to find a template that looks similar to the design you are trying to build. If you can’t, let us know in the [#ui-coalition](https://pingidentity.slack.com/messages/C0P4USREK) channel.

## Template Source
The source code for every template can be accessed with the “Source” link at the top-right. This code should look similar to what you write for your product. There’s one major caveat. We’ve written the templates to use component state rather than a Redux store. This is to make the templates easier to understand by keeping all the logic in one place.

Using the UI Library is all about using components. Over several years of development, we have built up a large body of components in order to support the design of Ping products. If you can't find what you need, contact us in the [#ui-coalition](https://pingidentity.slack.com/messages/C0P4USREK) channel.

## Finding Components
We understand that one of the biggest challenges in using the UI Library is just finding the component you’re looking for. There are two ways to get to a component: either browse the Components section of this demo site or use the search from the header bar. Once you’re familiar with the names of components, the search will be your best bet. If you are trying to find the component that matches a design, try looking through the Templates section to see if there’s a template that uses that pattern.

## Importing Components
The Library is structured so that you import components as separate files. You can find the path for a component in the subtitle of that component’s demo page.

## Using a component
The demo page for a component contains basic examples for how to use the component. The render function for the demo is shown below the rendered component, so you can see which props were used.

## Component Documentation
Every component has a documentation page that is linked to from the top right of its demo page. “Documentation” takes to you to that documentation. “Source” will show you the source file for the component, in case you need to dig that deep. “Demo” will show you the full source for the demo itself, which can be helpful in figuring out how to use the component. You can also navigate through all component documentation by clicking the help icon in the header bar.

## Flags
Some components support the ‘flags’ prop, which lets you tweak functionality. Flags allow us to release new functionality or try out different default behaviors without breaking backwards compatibility. The component’s demo will list the flags it supports and let you turn them on and off to see what the effects are. When you are ready to use the flags in your own app, you’ll provide them to the prop as an array of strings.

## Render Props
Some components use a render prop pattern to make it easier to add functionality to a component during implementation. For example, we often use this pattern when rendering buttons that might need to be wrapped in one of our Tooltip components. More information can be found on the Render Props page.

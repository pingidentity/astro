### Icon

**V4 Behavior:** Displays an icon with only a SPAN tag unless it contains `children` or `type` is set to "leading".

**V3 Behavior:** Displays a block element with an icon that has right margin unless `type` is set to "inline".

**Recommendation:** Set `type` to either "leading" or "inline".

### ExpandableRow

**V4 Behavior:** Each ExpandableRow will use a standalone CSS class to style them even out of context.

**V3 Behavior:** ExpandableRows get their styling from a surrounding element.

**Recommendation:** Add the flag 'expandable-row-class' to each ExpandableRow.

### ButtonBar

**V4 Behavior:** The discard button will be styled the same as a cancel button.

**V3 Behavior:** The discard button is styled like a standard button.

**Recommendation:** Set the 'fix-discard-button' flag for ButtonBar or use the props for a cancel button instead.

### Button

**V4 Behavior:** All buttons, including those with the 'add' icon, will have margin on their right side unless other styles from, for instance, a container remove it.

**V3 Behavior:** Buttons with the icon "add" have their margin removed.

**Recommendation:** Set the 'add-button-margin' flag to keep the margin or set the `noSpacing` prop to true on a button to keep it removed.

### Link

**V4 Behavior:** Displays a link with only an A tag unless `type` is set to "block".

**V3 Behavior:** Displays a block element with a link inside it unless it:
* has `children` or some `type` other than block is set
* doesn't have `title` or `count` set

### Messages

**V4 Behavior:** The WARNING message type will show a yellow banner.

**V3 Behavior:** The WARNING message type shows a red error banner.

**Recommendation:** Use NOTICE instead of WARNING. (Or set a flag for "fixed-messages-constants".)

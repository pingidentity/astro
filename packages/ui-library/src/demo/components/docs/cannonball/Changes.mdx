### Icon

**V4 Behavior:** Displays an icon with only a SPAN tag unless it contains `children` or `type` is set to "leading".

**V3 Behavior:** Displays a block element with an icon that has right margin unless `type` is set to "inline".

**Recommendation:** Set `type` to either "leading" or "inline".

### ExpandableRow

**V4 Behavior:** Each ExpandableRow will use a standalone CSS class to style them even out of context.

**V3 Behavior:** ExpandableRows get their styling from a surrounding element.

**Recommendation:** Add the flag 'expandable-row-class' to each ExpandableRow.

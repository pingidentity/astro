# V4: Cannonball Overview

## Why a major release?

- Update outdated React methodologies
- Design standards have evolved
- New approaches to the developer experience
- Untangle legacy CSS and markup
- Standardize component APIs

## Developer Impact

- Use components and props instead of CSS classes
- Reduce custom CSS - should be applied only to custom classNames and should have a removal date
- Tests should target test hooks (eg, data-ids) instead of classNames or tag names
- Some default functionality changes (Stateful vs Stateless)

## Developer Experience Improvements

- No import paths necessary – components can be imported by name (import TextField from ui-library/TextField)
- More flexibility: Render props and HOCs
- Easier to use documentation site
- Patch releases for automatic bug fixes
- Better process for pull requests
- More developer outreach

## Revamping CSS

- Components and props take the place of commonly-used className
- Better testing hooks that don’t require certain classNames and DOM structure
- Continued support of custom classNames
- Start rewriting all CSS with BEM classNames to better encapsulate styles

## New and Better Templates
- More templates with complete integration testing
- Templates are built only with components – no class names needed

## Stronger Testing
- More screenshot tests
- Cross-browser screenshot testing
- Snapshot tests to ensure reliability of testing hooks

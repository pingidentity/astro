# The Release

Version 4 of the library will be released in August 2019.
All breaking changes will be finalized and documented by May 2019 so that developers will have several months to respond to the deprecation and upgrade warnings that weâ€™ll be adding between February and May.
The upgrade experience will allow projects to opt into most of the v4 functionality while still using v3 ensuring an easy and smooth upgrade.

The UI Library team is committed to giving our developers and users the best experience possible. If you have any suggestions for v4 features or questions / concerns about the upgrade and timeline please reach out to us on the [#ui-coalition](https://pingidentity.slack.com/messages/C0P4USREK) Slack channel.

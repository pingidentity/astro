See the UI Library demo app "Basic App" tutorial for a step-by-step description on building this app.
See the UI Library demo app "Prototyping" tutorial for a step-by-step guide on how to use this app for prototyping.



Running the app
-------------------
Run
`npm install && npm run start`
and open http://localhost:8081/index.html in the browser.



Verifying the local changes
---------------------------
`npm run lint`
runs the linting



Building the Basic App
-----------------------
The basic app's static assets are generated by running: `npm run pack`.
This only generates the static assets and does not upload to hosting.
To both generate static assets and upload to hosting, see the following paragraph.

The basic app's static assets can be packaged and uploaded for hosting by executing a makefile recipe:
#1. Navigate to the root basic app folder: basic-app
#2. Execute the following makefile recipe: `make package-and-upload-for-hosting`

See the *scripts* section in package.json for more options.

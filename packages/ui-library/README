RUN THE LIBRARY
===============
Run
$ npm install && npm run start
and open http://localhost:8080/index.html in the browser.


VERIFYING THE LOCAL CHANGES
===========================
$ npm run verify
runs the linting and the testing using the global node/npm installation

$ make verify
runs the build (just like on the build machine); it downloads node and npm
locally, installs the required node modules, and runs the linting and testing.

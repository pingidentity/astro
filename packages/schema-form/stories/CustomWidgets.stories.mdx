# Custom Widgets
Custom widgets can be passed into the Schema Form through the `widgets` prop. They will be merged
with any existing themed widgets. It's also possible to override existing themed widgets since
custom widgets have priority. To do this, pass in a custom widget component as the value and an
existing widget name as the key, e.g. `{ TextWidget: MyWidget }`. A complete list of default widget 
names is viewable [in the RJSF documentation](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-customization/custom-widgets-fields/).

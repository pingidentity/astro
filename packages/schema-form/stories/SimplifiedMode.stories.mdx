## Simplified Mode
The default mode of this package includes internal state handling and other custom capabilities to
support teams who need that functionality. If that functionality is not needed or desired, it can
be turned off by passing `mode="simplified"` into the Form props. This will return the form to a
basic wrapper around RJSF while still supporting Ping UX theming out of the box.

This prop cannot be changed run-time - significant differences in internal logic will crash at rendering phase.

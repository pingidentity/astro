Currently, standard props from React JSON Schema Form are supported for this widget:

- [uiSchema Props](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/uiSchema/)

However, please understand this is a work in progress. If you have questions or issues implementing any of the linked props,
please reach out to the #ui-coalition slack channel or open a ticket following the steps in the contribution section of [overview](/?path=/docs/overview--page#contributing).

# Custom Conditionals


## Form Props


### `Rules`
When building a form, you may want to render some fields conditionally based off of the user's selection. Fortunately `rules` prop
allows for just this! 

The below example uses 'not' to determine which fields should be shown based off a user's response. 

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ConditionalsExample} />
</Canvas>

The first condition translates as -  when dropdownExample is not yes, trigger remove event for colorList.
Essentially, if the user selects 'no', we do not need any more information from them, so we don't want to render any more fields.

```html
const rules = [{
  conditions: {
    dropdownExample: {
      not: {
        is: 'Yes',
      },
    },
  },
  event: {
    type: 'remove',
    params: {
      field: 'colorList',
    },
  },
},
{
  conditions: {
    colorList: {
      not: {
        is: 'Other',
      },
    },
  },
  event: {
    type: 'remove',
    params: {
      field: 'otherField',
    },
  },
},
];

 <Form
      schema={('Schema', schema)}
      uiSchema={('uiSchema', uiSchema)}
      rules={rules}
/>
```


## How to customize conditionals
Fortunately, there are a lot of ways to utilize and customize conditional logic.

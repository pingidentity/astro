# Custom Object Builder
This shows how to implement an object builder using a custom [FieldTemplate](https://gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com/ux/pingux/-/tree/master/packages/schema-form/stories/recipes/CustomFieldTemplate.js),
ObjectFieldTemplate, and [ObjectField](https://gitlab.corp.pingidentity.com/ux/pingux/-/tree/master/packages/schema-form/stories/recipes/CustomObjectField.js).
Currently in this demo, you can pass in additional props that can be deleted on focus state using `additionalOptions`
in the schema. As per the usual ObjectField, currently it just sets the new key to the default field type, but this
can be modified as needed.
